# Hi, Welcome! I'm Ceina Ellison 👋🏾

I've always had a passion for web development and software engineering. Through my years of experience in sales and administration work, I've found myself searching for where I am now, working on applications and live websites. I'm a General Assembly Software Engineer Immersive graduate as I have successfully demonstrated my abilities with multiple programming languages, libraries & frameworks. I continue to develop my skills and hope to make a meaningful impact in today's society.

I love collaborating with others to create something wonderful, and if that's a passion of yours as well, let's connect! I'd love to hear from you!
