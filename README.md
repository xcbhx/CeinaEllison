# Hi, Welcome! I'm Ceina Ellison 👋🏾

I’m currently completing my undergraduate degree in Applied Computer Science, with a focus on Software Engineering and leveraging technology to drive positive change.

My career path has been diverse, including roles in sales and administration, but my passion has always been rooted in web development and application engineering. I have hands-on experience with various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, and I’m dedicated to building impactful applications that address real-world challenges.

Alongside my technical studies, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management from Baruch College and an Associate degree in Business Administration from LaGuardia Community College. My journey is fueled by continuous learning and growth, and I’m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
